# To-Do List Application 

This project is **Task 2** of my Python Internship.  
It is a simple **command-line To-Do List Manager** built using Python.

The app allows you to **add**, **view**, and **remove** tasks, and it stores all tasks in a text file so they remain saved even after closing the program.
